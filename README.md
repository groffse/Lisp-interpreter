# Lisp-interpreter


A lisp interpreter built using the mpc library (https://github.com/orangeduck/mpc)
The lisp is based on "Build your own Lisp" (http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/).

Some of the features are:

* Data types: integer, float and string
* Equality operators
* Functions
* Partly working objects

Compile:
``gcc AltLisp.c mpc.c``


Have only been tested on windows 10
